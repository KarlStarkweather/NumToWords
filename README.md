#### _Numbers to Words is an application to convert a number to an English string._

#### Rules
_Digits have English names which change depending on the position they hold in a number. For instance: 
* 5 is 'five', but if in the tens position it is 'fifty'. 
* In the hundreds position digits return to their original names: 'five' followed by 'hundred'. 
* Numbers 10 through 19 also have unique names. 
* These patterns repeat every three positions in large numbers, as in 'twelve thousand' or 'forty million'
